# ListApp
 
why im making this app?
a lot of apps out there for lists but none of them are like 
if i write sometihng its written on stone - there is no way to delete it 

i want a list app without any delete buttons

you can archieve and restore but never delete 


# todo

1. add bootstrap or some way to grid
2. Search
3. make sub lists
4. breadcrums
5. use this as base to make goals app
6. Edit
7. Delete if Really needed
